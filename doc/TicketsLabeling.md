## Tickets labeling

To select a ticket please consult with your team and team lead. Suggest several tickets in the direction which your team chose to work on. To find available tickets in your direction use the labeling system of GitHub. All available and unlocked tickets are labeled with the label `available`.

Labels:

- Availability: `available`, `taken`, `locked`
- Difficulty: `easy`, `medium`, `hard`
- Type: `core`, `graphics`, `server`, `multiplayer`
- Importance: `critical`

The task with the label `critical` should be implemented first.
The task with the label `locked` depends on other tasks. Read the task description for details.
